Tano - An open IP TV player
===================================

Build dependencies:
===================
The latest version of Qt4, libvlc-qt, libvlc and CMake is prefered.

- g++ >=4, make (http://gcc.gnu.org, http://www.mingw.org)
- cmake >=2.8.6 (http://www.cmake.org)
- Qt development package >=4.8 (http://qt.nokia.com)
- libvlc-qt-dev >=0.7.0 (http://projects.tano.si/en/library) and its dependencies


Runtime dependencies:
=====================
- Qt library, same version
- libvlc-qt library, same version


Compilation:
============
Go to Tano root directory and run:
(this will create a build directory and compile Tano)
	$ mkdir build
	$ cd build
	$ cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=prefix
	$ make


Installation
============
	$ make install


Windows users
=============
Compilation process should not differ too much.
If some libraries are not found, use cmake gui.
Installation will copy all necessary files to the set location.


Troubleshooting:
================
If you get the following error (could be only the last line!):

	QT_QMAKE_EXECUTABLE set to qmake version: QTVERSION = **Unknown**
	QT_QMAKE_EXECUTABLE = /usr/bin/qmake, please set to path to qmake from qt4.
	Qt qmake not found!

Then you have to run cmake with the following switch:
	$ cmake . -DQT_QMAKE_EXECUTABLE="/usr/lib/qt4/bin/qmake"
	(replace the path to fit your needs).
